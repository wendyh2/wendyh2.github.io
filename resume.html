              <p class="mb-0">A'ali'i Mentoring is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in Hawaii that helps young adults from underserved communities navigate and persevere in higher education. Many young people from communities underrepresented in higher education face the typical challenges related to the transition to college and also daunting difficulties including academic, financial, familial, and personal hardships. They may not be aware of or have access to financial, educational, and career resources and opportunities. As a result, many young people do not achieve their higher education</p>

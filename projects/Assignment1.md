summary: "Assignment 1 tasks students with creating an e-commerce website selling products or services of our choice. They must enable users to select quantities, validate input, calculate totals with tax and shipping, and display invoices. The project covers building an information system, designing a user interface, processing input on a server, and using dynamic data sources. Students use arrays of objects for product display, implement server-side data validation, and ensure good UI design. This assignment is part of a larger 3-part project, serving as a foundational step for our final assignments."

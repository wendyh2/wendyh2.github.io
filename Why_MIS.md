## Prompt: Why did you decide to major in MIS or take ITM 352?

I honestly wasn't too sure what I wanted to really do as a career and am still going back and forth about some things. However, I had the chance to take BUS 311 in the summer with an amazing professor and she made me much more interested in majoring in MIS. I knew I wanted to double major in something else besides marketing because almost 50% of business students at UH Manoa are marketing majors, so I had to make myself stand out. I debated majoring in management instead because it would be easier than MIS but I like the challenges it presents and want to learn more about it and continue to improve. I think I might still major in management as well anyway, but I need to wait and see how I can balance everything. However, I'm excited and nervous about how this class will progress, and hope it doesn't overwhelm me too much.

## Who am I?

I am currently in my junior year at UH Manoa. I went to McKinley High School and didn't enjoy my time there, but am grateful for some of the amazing people I've met during my time there. I was born and raised in Hawaii, and I am trilingual. I can speak two different Chinese dialects, Cantonese and Taishanese, and obviously English. Things I like to do in my free time are nails, sleeping, and shopping. I am very interested in potentially getting a master's as well or even going to law school. This is my first semester taking a class in the MIS program and I'm very excited to learn more and grow my knowledge in programming. I look forward to how this class will progress and wish all my classmates the best as well!

## How it Went?

I had a fantastic time engaging with the tech professionals at the event. I believe I left a lasting positive impression on many of them. While it wasn't a formal recruiting event, it's important to remember that networking can lead to future opportunities. Who knows, I might consider applying for internships connected to the companies they work for, and they could recall, "Oh, that's the girl who made meaningful connections and actively engaged with everyone." Right from the outset, I enthusiastically initiated conversations with the tech professionals, foregoing even the tempting free food provided. My primary focus was connecting with seasoned professionals in the field to gain insights into their experiences. I made sure to exchange contact information for potential follow-ups. To any professionals who may be reading this and have received my GitHub profile, I want to express my gratitude for the **valuable and enlightening discussions**. I gleaned a wealth of knowledge from individuals with diverse backgrounds, and I am certain I would have regretted not attending this event.

## What I Would do for Next Time?

I will be more committed to enhancing my networking approach for future events. While I did some preliminary research on the attendees beforehand, I understand the importance of delving deeper into their backgrounds. Demonstrating my motivation and genuine interest in learning about these professionals is crucial. Taking initiative can truly set me apart from others in such settings. During the event, although I attended with friends, I consciously chose to branch out on my **OWN**. It was imperative to **establish my own connections and presence**. Engaging with professionals alongside my friends would have made it harder for them to remember me as an individual. While the event was informal, I believe it's essential to make a lasting impression whenever I meet professionals from any field. Looking back, I realize that carrying my heavy school bag may have appeared unprofessional. Next time, I plan to leave it in a designated area to avoid inconvenience and present myself more polished and prepared. Furthermore, I aim to improve my conversation skills by crafting better questions for professionals. There were instances where I struggled to find the right things to say or inquire about. Although I wished for more preparation time in the past, I'm determined to dedicate ample effort to research and practice for future events, ensuring that I'm better equipped to make the most out of such opportunities.

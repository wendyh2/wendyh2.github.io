## Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details:

In Assignment 2, I successfully implemented a functional login and registration page, storing user data in a JSON file. For more details, please refer to the [link](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html) to the assignment page on my GitHub repository.

## 1. What did you learn from this assignment?

This assignment enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of global variables. I gained valuable insights into creating effective login and registration systems, including the implementation of a functional logout button.

## 2. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and can do them without copying the screencast:

WODs have proven to be a pivotal learning tool, challenging me to execute tasks independently while articulating my understanding. The absence of a screencast during later WODs pushed me to troubleshoot and think critically, building my confidence through perseverance and collaboration with classmates.

## 3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

I tackled this assignment independently, without a partner. However, I did receive assistance from Dan when needed.

## 4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

When faced with challenges, I sought assistance from Dan during several meetings and utilized ChatGPT when needed. Dan provided crucial support in creating a functional logout button and implementing a redirect page for logout confirmation.

## 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

Assignment 2 posed greater complexity, particularly concerning the login and registration pages, including the incorporation of IRs. Handling data within the user JSON file was a significant aspect involving code retrieving existing data and updating it with new registration information. Although more extensive, this assignment improved my overall comprehension.

## 6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging:

I spent approximately 25% of my time pondering solutions, 45% writing code, and 30% on testing and debugging.

## 7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

Notable successes include the significant improvement in my problem-solving and debugging skills compared to the previous assignment. However, I encountered difficulties with the logout functionality, struggling to ensure proper user logout. Collaborating with Dan was pivotal in overcoming this hurdle and fixing it to start working properly.

## 8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

If given the chance to revisit this project, I would opt for simpler code structures. Acknowledging Dan's advice about code complexity, I would seek his input more frequently to explore alternative, more straightforward approaches.

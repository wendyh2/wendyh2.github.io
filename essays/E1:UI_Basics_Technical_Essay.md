## Browser History 1

In all honesty, there were a lot of rules to consider when doing browser history 1. I was making tiny syntax errors that took me so much time and effort to detect that I was becoming really frustrated. I tried browser history 1 about three times and still didn't obtain Rx, but it's possible that I didn't remember the information because I tried it again the following day. Because you'll forget a lot of information if you only do it a few times and try again the next day, I find that doing it repeatedly in a row is definitely much better. For Browser History 1, I finished it in 24 minutes, but after watching the screencast, I noticed I had made several mistakes and had to start over. I advise making notes so you don't forget; for me, I kept forgetting that with the # for the table of contents, which made it ineffective and time-consuming. 

## Browser History 2

Since we were styling it rather than constructing it from scratch, which was a major struggle, Browser History 2 was much simpler to create. Rereading the CSS notes is a good idea because it really does help, especially when you're stuck. I did forget some semicolons, which is why some of my code didn't work. When I went back to see what was wrong, I noticed I had forgotten some semicolons. Additionally, I failed to apply closing tags, which is terrible because I kept getting stuck and believed my style.css was off instead of my index.html. I went back later to verify, recognized what I had done, and made an effort to avoid doing it again. I completed it in 9 minutes, which was Rx, and I felt much better afterward than I had after doing Browser History 1. Your code won't function as intended if there are any syntax problems, so I strongly advise checking it all.

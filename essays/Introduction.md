## Who am I?

I am currently in my junior year at UH Manoa. I went to McKinley High School and graduated class of 2021. I was born and raised in Hawaii, and I am trilingual. I can speak two different Chinese dialects, Cantonese and Taishanese, and obviously English. I have 3 sisters, two older and one younger. 

## Hobbies and Interests:

Things I like to do in my free time are nails, sleeping, and shopping. I am very interested in potentially getting a master's as well or even going to law school. This is my first semester taking a class in the MIS program and I'm very excited to learn more and grow my knowledge in programming. I look forward to how this class will progress and wish all my classmates the best as well!

  <h2 id="smartphoneproducts1-with-variables">SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables</h2>

<p>While working on SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables, I encountered several technical challenges on my laptop that were unrelated to the code. For instance, I had trouble renaming a file, and it inexplicably wouldn’t allow me to do so. I spent a considerable amount of extra time troubleshooting this issue, and oddly, it only allowed me to rename the file after I failed to record my screencast. Additionally, I faced difficulties with the “find and replace” function, as it was not functioning as expected. I am not sure why I kept having this issue, but I would appreciate any insights you might have Michelle, which you can put in your feedback/comments. It took me about three attempts to achieve Rx, which felt like quite a lengthy process. I also inadvertently overlooked updating some numbers, causing the code to malfunction on occasion. To address this, I made sure to meticulously review all the numbers to prevent such errors in my final attempt. I approached the task with a balance of thoroughness and speed, but my ultimate goal was to get Rx. In the future, I intend to prioritize getting everything to work correctly from the outset.</p>

<h2 id="invoice-1">Invoice 1</h2>

<p>Working on Invoice 1 proved to be quite challenging, as it took me four attempts to complete successfully. The difficulties primarily arose from failing to update certain numbers in the code, which rendered the entire project non-functional. During one recording session, I misplaced some elements, resulting in my information, such as prices, not updating as intended. There were also instances when I overlooked number changes, causing functionality issues. The overall process was quite time-consuming, and I admit that I didn’t persist in trying to resolve the issues as much as I should have, partially due to time constraints. I found myself rushing towards the end of the task. I resorted to searching for solutions to specific problems I encountered, which helped me identify and rectify certain issues. In hindsight, I know that I should allocate more time for WODs in the future, avoiding the last-minute rush. I also plan to double-check all the code for accuracy and functionality. Maintaining the live server feature and rigorously testing each piece of code as it’s inputted will be crucial to prevent time-consuming backtracking in case of errors.</p>

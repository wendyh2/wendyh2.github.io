## Browser History 2

Since we were styling it rather than constructing it from scratch, a major struggle, Browser History 2 was much simpler to create. Rereading the CSS notes is a good idea because it really does help, especially when you're stuck. I did forget some semicolons, which is why some of my code didn't work. When I returned to see what was wrong, I noticed I had forgotten some semicolons. Additionally, I failed to apply closing tags, which is terrible because I kept getting stuck and believed my style.css was off instead of my index.html. I went back later to verify, recognized what I had done, and tried to avoid doing it again. The first time around, I finished it in about 19 minutes, but redid it to get practice and the hang of it. I completed it in 9 minutes, which was Rx, and I felt much better afterward than after doing Browser History 1. Your code won't function as intended if there are any syntax problems, so I strongly advise checking it all.

## Browser History 3

It was a little annoying the first time I did Browser History 3, but that was largely my fault for not double-checking my code. One benefit of using the closing tag for div is that it provides some prompts for me to use one if I forget. This frequently occurred due to my carelessness and, I believe, exhaustion. I won't lie; I was quite exhausted while performing this, which caused me to forget a few things. When I initially completed it, it took me around 25 minutes, which is absurd considering how easy it was. To avoid making stupid mistakes, I advise completing this while still awake. Rereading the notes and materials is also necessary for it to be effective. When I attempted it again, I did better and finished in around 13 minutes. Do not rush things and keep in mind that repetition is necessary for something to stick in your head. Remember to prepare for WODs in advance if you can. However, to be fair, I had a lot of things to take care of, such as club recruitment, which has consumed a lot of my time.

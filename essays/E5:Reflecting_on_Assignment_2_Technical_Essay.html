  <h2 id="provide-a-brief-introduction-to-the-assignment-along-with-a-link-to-this-page-for-further-details">Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details:</h2>

<p>In Assignment 2, I successfully implemented a functional login and registration page, storing user data in a JSON file. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">link</a> to the assignment page on my GitHub repository.</p>

<h2 id="1-what-did-you-learn-from-this-assignment">1. What did you learn from this assignment?</h2>

<p>This assignment enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of global variables. I gained valuable insights into creating effective login and registration systems, including the implementation of a functional logout button.</p>

<h2 id="2-i-have-learned-a-lot-from-doing-wods-and-can-do-them-without-copying-the-screencast">2. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and can do them without copying the screencast:</h2>

<p>WODs have proven to be a pivotal learning tool, challenging me to execute tasks independently while articulating my understanding. The absence of a screencast during later WODs pushed me to troubleshoot and think critically, building my confidence through perseverance and collaboration with classmates.</p>

<h2 id="3-did-you-work-with-a-partner-assign-an-estimated-percentage-on-the-amount-each-team-member-contributed-to-the-assignment-including-yourself">3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</h2>

<p>I tackled this assignment independently, without a partner. However, I did receive assistance from Dan when needed.</p>

<h2 id="4-how-did-you-get-help-when-you-needed-it-what-did-you-need-help-with">4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h2>

<p>When faced with challenges, I sought assistance from Dan during several meetings and utilized ChatGPT when needed. Dan provided crucial support in creating a functional logout button and implementing a redirect page for logout confirmation.</p>

<h2 id="5-how-was-developing-this-assignment-different-than-assignment-1">5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h2>

<p>Assignment 2 posed greater complexity, particularly concerning the login and registration pages, including the incorporation of IRs. Handling data within the user JSON file was a significant aspect involving code retrieving existing data and updating it with new registration information. Although more extensive, this assignment improved my overall comprehension.</p>

<h2 id="6-estimate-the--of-time-you-spent-a-thinking-about-how-to-do-something-b-writing-code-but-do-not-include-testing-c-testing-and-debugging">6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging:</h2>

<p>I spent approximately 25% of my time pondering solutions, 45% writing code, and 30% on testing and debugging.</p>

<h2 id="7-describe-what-worked-well-with-this-project-what-did-not-work-well">7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h2>

<p>Notable successes include the significant improvement in my problem-solving and debugging skills compared to the previous assignment. However, I encountered difficulties with the logout functionality, struggling to ensure proper user logout. Collaborating with Dan was pivotal in overcoming this hurdle and fixing it to start working properly.</p>

<h2 id="8-if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-do-things-differently-what-would-you-do-differently">8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h2>

<p>If given the chance to revisit this project, I would opt for simpler code structures. Acknowledging Danâ€™s advice about code complexity, I would seek his input more frequently to explore alternative, more straightforward approaches.</p>

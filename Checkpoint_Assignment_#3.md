## Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should be clear. Here is an example PPT prototype


Click HERE [link](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html) for a brief overview of our prototype layout and functionality for our Assignment 3 e-commerce website.

## Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.

Our design includes a dedicated shopping cart page, where users can manage the quantities of their chosen products. This page will bear a resemblance to the invoice page, offering a preview of selected items and their quantities for final confirmation. The cart functionality hinges on session-based data storage, maintaining the user's selection details. Users have the flexibility to modify product quantities directly in the cart, either by increasing or deleting them entirely. Once satisfied with their choices, they can initiate the purchase process by clicking the "Complete Purchase" button, leading them to the Invoice page. However, access to the invoice page requires either logging in or registering an account. Unauthenticated users will be redirected to the login page to ensure secure processing.

## 2. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and can do them without copying the screencast:

WODs have proven to be a pivotal learning tool, challenging me to execute tasks independently while articulating my understanding. The absence of a screencast during later WODs pushed me to troubleshoot and think critically, building my confidence through perseverance and collaboration with classmates.

## 3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

I tackled this assignment independently, without a partner. However, I did receive assistance from Dan when needed.

## 4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

When faced with challenges, I sought assistance from Dan during several meetings and utilized ChatGPT when needed. Dan provided crucial support in creating a functional logout button and implementing a redirect page for logout confirmation.

## 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

Assignment 2 posed greater complexity, particularly concerning the login and registration pages, including the incorporation of IRs. Handling data within the user JSON file was a significant aspect involving code retrieving existing data and updating it with new registration information. Although more extensive, this assignment improved my overall comprehension.

## 6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging:

I spent approximately 25% of my time pondering solutions, 45% writing code, and 30% on testing and debugging.

## 7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

Notable successes include the significant improvement in my problem-solving and debugging skills compared to the previous assignment. However, I encountered difficulties with the logout functionality, struggling to ensure proper user logout. Collaborating with Dan was pivotal in overcoming this hurdle and fixing it to start working properly.

## 8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

If given the chance to revisit this project, I would opt for simpler code structures. Acknowledging Dan's advice about code complexity, I would seek his input more frequently to explore alternative, more straightforward approaches.
